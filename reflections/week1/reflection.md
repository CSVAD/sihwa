## Week 1 Reflection

Computers are definitely expanding our abilities and possibilities we can explore for creative activities, regardless of the original purpose of its invention that is not aesthetic or artistic but mainly calculation. In using computers and understanding computing, there are many abstractions lying in from micro to macro levels or hardware to software. It is interesting to read McCullough's article that discusses how software design and the use of computing can enhance the level of abstraction in creating artifacts and what constitutes it in terms of formal structuralism. Especially, what he talks about multiple instantiation and reproducibility as one of the advantages of notation, quoting Goodman's terminology, "autographic" and "allographic", reminds me of Walter Benjamin's idea of the aura, the unique aesthetic authority of an artwork, written in his book <em>The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction</em> (1935).

In discussing the limitations of structured symbolic thinking, I agree that we need to find a balance between the use of a symbolic system and human abilities, skills, intuition, and experience. This perspective can be found in Curtis Roads' book, <em>Composing Electronic Music: A New Aesthetic</em> (2015) that presents fundamental aesthetic issues in electronic music with "the principle of economy of selection, which means the ability to choose one or a few perceptually and aesthetically optimal choices from a vast desert of unremarkable possibilities". In especially, he says that creating music can be a magical process, quoting Francis Bacon's definition of magic: "Magic is the science which applies the knowledge of hidden forms to the production of wonderful operations"
