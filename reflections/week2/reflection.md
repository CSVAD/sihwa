## Week 2 Reflection

In <em>Design Basics</em>(1979) written by David A. Lauer and Stephen Pentak, they introduce design principles with unity, emphasis/focal point, scale/proportion, balance, and rhythm. Here, repetition is explained as one of the ways to achieve unity, whereas the grid is for unity with variety along with varied repetition. We could consider that these attributes also have a relationship with regularity and randomness, two formal aspects of the 10 PRINT program that result in compelling visuals.

A common point can be found from a definition of the grid, which is "a framework within which human intuition and invention can operate and that it can subvert", and a sentence that "regularity can only be defined by exceptions to it, by those moments when the regular becomes irregular". Especially, words like "subvert" and "irregular".

As Pythagoreans insisted, the proportions of parts and their interrelationships could be the keys to beauty. Sometimes, breaking symmetry in this relationship could make more attractive results, evoking tension. Utilizing and resolving conflictions such as symmetry/asymmetry, tension/release or harmony/inharmony is considered as one of the fundamental techniques in visual arts for composition in space, in music for composition in time, and even in visual music for composition in both space and time.

This convention of regularity and variation will always be a part of elements in creating any types of computational design tools or software.
