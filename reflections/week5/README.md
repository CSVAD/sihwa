Bret Victor's Stop Drawing Dead Fish and Dynamic Pictures

It is definitely interesting to have a simulation system with the capability of dynamic manipulation and real-time interaction. It would be helpful not only for making a creation procedure efficient but also for supporting the expressiveness of visual artists. As he pointed out, programming languages are hard for visual artists to express something in a way they imagine. A system or tool built by a programming langugage to support art creation need to be compatible with the temporal and spatial nature of 'visual thinking', not just relying on the procedural nature of computational thinking.
